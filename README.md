> 🚨 If you just landed on this page and you're not sure what Docable notebook is, please take a look at [docable.cloud](https://docable.cloud/) or the project's [readme](https://github.com/ottomatica/docable-notebooks). This repository contains an onboarding guild for how to _use_ Docable.

# docable-starter-template

Docable empowers you to write and publish your CS course content, tutorials, blog posts as an advanced interactive document on [`https://docable.cloud/`](https://docable.cloud/). Follow this short guide for a quick onboarding and publish your first Docable notebook in the next 10 minutes ⏲.

Follow these three simple steps:
- 📚 [Create a repo for your notebook](#create-repository-for-your-notebook)
- ✍ [Write your document](#write-your-notebook)
- 🚀 [Publish your document](#Publish)

## 📚 Create repository for your notebook

[Click here](https://github.com/ottomatica/docable-starter-template/generate) to use this repository as a template for your first notebook, or alternatively [fork it](https://github.com/ottomatica/docable-starter-template/fork).

Each Docable notebook is managed and stored in it's own GitHub repository. Think of a GitHub repository as the whole notebook 📒 and its markdown files as the pages of the notebook 📄. Normally you should create a new repo or use one of your existing ones. However, for this quick onboarding guide we recommend [using this repository as a template](https://github.com/ottomatica/docable-starter-template/generate) because it already contains a few example notebooks which might be useful to use as a starting point.

## ✍ Write your notebook

After creating your GitHub repository, you're ready to start writing your first notebook.
First clone your repository and then create a markdown file using the code editor of your choice. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<USERNAME>/docable-starter-template
cd docable-starter-template
code starter-notebook.md # we're using VS Code here, but feel free to use anything else
```

We included a [`starter-notebook.md`](./starter-notebook.md) in this repository as a starting point. See this document for explaination of the structure of a notebook file, and the supported content.
